                <u>Game Developer</u> - Since I was young, I’m dreaming of creating my own game and that’s the reason why I choose this course. I even tried to create a game though it was not finished yet. With that experience I somehow realized it was very hard to create a game like you need to do the visuals, user interface, the music effects, the logic, and the storyline it made me more motivated to do so and hopefully I will become a game developer someday.
