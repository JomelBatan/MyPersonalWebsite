            <p class="par" align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are only three kinds of people in this world: those who try, those who pretend to try, and those who doesn't even try.
                I'm proudly part of the tryer's club, always up for new challenges and opportunities.
                Ever since when I was young, I really love playing games. It was one of the factors why I choose to my current course I really wanted to create my own game. Since then, I tried to learn stuffs in depth with technology, and programming caught my attention so I somehow grow some interest learning to do so. I liked the idea of being creative in a way of logical thinking and problem solving. So let this website speak for what skills I currently had.
                In this vast world of tryers, pretenders, and non-triers who are you in this adventure called life? I Jomel Batan Computer Science student let me share my story.</p>

                This is my Family. This photo was taken on my aunt's wedding last April 1, 2023. My father's name was Ramil D. Batan he is a Security Guard at Para√±aque. He is a very reliable father that provides everything for us, his sacrifices are one of things that fueling me to strike even harder. My mother's name is Felicitas R. Batan she is a house wife and a Sari-Sari store owner she is a loving mother who take care and gives what we need. I have two siblings named Jerald Batan he is currently in high school and Jazzel Batan whose currently on elementary. They are the person I'm thinking when things get tough.
