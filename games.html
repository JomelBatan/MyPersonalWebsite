                        Game Freak created the Pokémon video game series, which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company publish as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Developed by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, the series debuted in 1996 with Pocket Monsters Red and Green for the Game Boy in Japan and as Pokémon Red and Blue elsewhere. The "core series" of role-playing games (RPGs) has continued on every Nintendo handheld system since the original Game Boy.

                Japanese video game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka are responsible for the long-running The Legend of Zelda franchise. The series is primarily created and published by Nintendo, though Flagship, Vanpool, and Grezzo have worked on portable installments and re-releases. The gameplay combines elements from both action RPGs and action-adventure games.
