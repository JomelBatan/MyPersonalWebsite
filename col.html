                Right now, I’m taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science here in Capiz State University Pontevedra Campus. There are three courses I am considering entering college BS Information Technology, BS Computer Science, and BS Architecture. Since the other two courses was not offered here in Pontevedra Campus I choose BSCS. I don’t really have a lot of story to share since I’m still at my sophomore years and my freshmen years was composed of online classes I will include some of highlights of it.

                Second Year during this time it was implemented the limited face to face learning we can go to the campus only if we had a laboratory class we came by every Tuesday. During this time, we elected our homeroom officers and somehow, I was elected as the P.I.O. Having new classmate became a new thing to everyone from the class was stranger to me. Though I’m not that close with all of them until now it seems like it would be fun to grow with this new environment.

                This was the first class picture that we have, this was taken after we take our midterm examination in The Entrepreneurial Mind. During this time fully face to face classes was not yet implemented.

                        This was when I won first place during Computer Science Week Programming Competition Java Category. Since Java was the first programming language, I know I didn’t hesitate to join the competition I know I have a big chance to win it. I'm confident with my skills lol.

                During the CS week I was belong to team black though I did not have interacted that much with them it’s a good group to be with. We dominated the CS week and won a lot of competitions. That’s what happened on my college years. The face-to-face classes just started few months ago, we are still in the stage of knowing each other, hoping that we could come together to build great memories.
